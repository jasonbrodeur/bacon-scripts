%%% period of days before and after
%%% y: The dependent variable looking to be filled
%%% win_size: The total, 2-sided size of the MDV window in days
%%%           e.g. Using 1/2hr data, a win_size value of 4 will average
%%%           values for 2 days (96pts) before, and 2 days (96) after the
%%%           point to be filled.
%%% pts_day: Specifies the number of points to make up a day (default = 48)
