%%% When we have fixed coefficients, the coefficients that are fed into 
%%% this function (c_hat), does not include the fixed coefficient (or else
%%% it would get adjusted by fminsearch, fmincon, etc...).However, we need
%%% that value in the proper place in c_hat, so that the function can be
%%% evaluated properly.  Therefore, we need to put it back into the right
%%% spot in c_hat, and evaluate the function, 
%%% We do not have to put it back in, as the only output is the cost
%%% function value.  Still with me?  Good.
%%% Put the coefficient in the right spot in c_hat for evaluation purposes:
